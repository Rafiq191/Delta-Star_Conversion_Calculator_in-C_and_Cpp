Project Title: Delta-Star Conversion Calculator in C and C++ Language

Project Description:

The "Delta-Star Conversion Calculator" is a software project aimed at developing a utility tool in both C and C++ programming languages. This project focuses on providing an efficient and user-friendly solution to convert electrical circuits between Delta (Δ) and Star (Y) configurations, which are common in three-phase power systems. The conversion between these configurations is essential in electrical engineering and power distribution to optimize circuit design, analysis, and troubleshooting.

Project Objectives:

Delta-Star Conversion: The primary objective of the project is to create a robust program that can convert electrical circuits from Delta to Star and vice versa. This conversion involves the transformation of resistances, voltages, currents, and impedances, maintaining the equivalence of the circuits.
User Interface: Develop a user interface that allows users to input circuit parameters such as resistances, voltages, and currents for both Delta and Star configurations. The program should then display the converted values in the target configuration.
Validation and Error Handling: Implement thorough validation checks to ensure that the input values are within acceptable ranges. Provide appropriate error messages and prompts for users to correct any invalid inputs.
Efficiency and Accuracy: Write algorithms that ensure accurate conversion calculations while maintaining computational efficiency. The program should handle various scenarios and edge cases effectively.
Modularity: Design the codebase in a modular manner, separating different aspects of the conversion process into distinct functions or classes. This promotes code reusability, readability, and ease of maintenance.
Documentation: Create clear and comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the program, the underlying conversion algorithms, and the structure of the code. This documentation will assist both users and potential contributors.
C and C++ Versions: Implement the project in both C and C++ languages to showcase the versatility of the languages and provide options for users based on their programming preferences.
Potential Features:

Conversion from Delta to Star configuration.
Conversion from Star to Delta configuration.
Handling various load configurations (balanced and unbalanced).
Support for different circuit parameters (resistance, impedance, voltage, and current).
Error handling for invalid inputs and scenarios
Interactive command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI).
Unit testing to verify the accuracy of conversion calculations.
Project Benefits:

Educational Use: The project can serve as an educational tool for students and professionals learning about three-phase circuits and their conversions.
Engineering Practice: Engineers can use the tool for quick conversions in practical applications, saving time and effort.
Open Source Contribution: The project can be developed as an open-source initiative, inviting collaboration and improvement from the programming community.
Practical Utility: The tool can be applied in industries dealing with power systems, electrical distribution, and industrial automation.
The "Delta-Star Conversion Calculator" project aims to provide a valuable resource for electrical engineers, students, and enthusiasts by simplifying the process of converting electrical circuits between Delta and Star configurations.
